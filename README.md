### Dai-Li Task Manager

Pronounced "daily," Dai-Li is a simple task manager application meant to help keep on track with repeating tasks. The app consists of a simple user interface and three tabs, meant to track your daily, weekly, and monthly tasks or goals.

Currently, Dai-Li is reliant on the PyQt5 GUI framework to operate and users must set up a virtual environment after which they can execute the program via a command line prompt. An executable version of the application is currently being worked on.
